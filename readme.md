# Canvas Clock Blazor

This is implementation of simple canvas clock in Blazor technology (TargetFramework: netcoreapp3.1).
Blazor communicate via javascript with html5 canvas to draw elements. Project uses simple endless loop running in C# invoking methods from JSInterop class. It should be rewritten to use more efficient drawing techniques by internal browser mechanisms like requestAnimationFrames.  
This project include only very simple controlling functions in JS to draw on canvas. My intentions was not making another canvas library for Blazor because there are some other efficient options like Blazor Canvas extensions to run drawing on canvas.
